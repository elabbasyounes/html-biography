                <span id="name"> Linus Bendict Torvalds,<br></span>
                <p>
                     is a finnish-American software engineer who is the creator and, historically, 
                     <br>the main developer of the Linux kernel,
                     used by linux distributions and other operating systems such as Android.<br>
                     he also created the distributed version control system Git 
                     and the scuba dive logging and planning software Subsurface.

                   <span class="sidetitles">Early years</span><br>
Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, on 28 December 1969. He is the son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds,
<br> the grandson of statistician Leo TÃ¶rnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds and the great-grandson of journalist and soldier Toivo Karanko. 
<br>His parents were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki in the 1960s. 
<br>His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland.<br> Torvalds was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize-winning American chemist,
<br>although in the book Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution, Torvalds is quoted as saying,
<br>"I think I was named equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character",
<br> noting that this makes him half "Nobel Prize-winning chemist" and half "blanket-carrying cartoon character".
<br>Torvalds attended the University of Helsinki between 1988 and 1996,<br> graduating with a master's degree in computer science from the NODES research group.
<br>His academic career was interrupted after his first year of study when he joined the Finnish Navy Nyland Brigade in the summer of 1989,<br> selecting the 11-month officer training program to fulfill the mandatory military service of Finland.
 He gained the rank of second lieutenant,<br> with the role of an artillery observer.<br> Torvalds bought computer science professor Andrew Tanenbaum's book Operating Systems: Design and Implementation,<br> in which Tanenbaum describes MINIX,
  an educational stripped-down version of Unix. In 1990, he resumed his university studies, <br>and was exposed to Unix for the first time, in the form of a DEC MicroVAX running ULTRIX. <br>His MSc thesis was titled Linux: A Portable Operating System.

  <br>His interest in computers began with a Commodore VIC-20, at the age of 11 in 1981, initially programming in BASIC, <br>but later by directly accessing the 6502 CPU in machine code. He did not make use of assembly language.<br> After the VIC-20 he purchased a Sinclair QL,
 which he modified extensively, especially its operating system. <br>"Because it was so hard to get software for it in Finland,<br> Linus wrote his own assembler and editor (in addition to Pac-Man graphics libraries)" <br>for the QL,as well as a few games. He wrote a Pac-Man clone named Cool Man.
 <br>On 5 January 1991 he purchased an Intel 80386-based clone of IBM PC before receiving his MINIX copy, <br>which in turn enabled him to begin work on Linux.
